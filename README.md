# What's this?

Cyber Rewared is a modern port of [Cyberware](https://github.com/Flaxbeard/Cyberware).
The original mod only supported versions 1.9.4 through 1.10.2, however there have been several ports
like [this one](https://github.com/An-Sar/Cyberware), which is for 1.12.

# What does this mod do?

This mod allows you to install cybernetic augments into yourself, which
give you special abilities. For example, you can install cybereyes,
which allow you to use the Targeting Overlay, which highlights nearby mobs.
